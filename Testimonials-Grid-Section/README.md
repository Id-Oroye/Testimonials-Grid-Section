## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Creating this project was very challenging and I am very glad it made me get really better with my CSS Grid. I also learned how to do some works with the @media query. 

### Continued development

I am looking to learning CSS Flexbox from now and most importantly, how to reduce my codebase, because I think there were a lot of unnecessary things in my code that I could have merged together somehow.

### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp  https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_intro.asp
These articles from W3Schools helped me to revise and also learn some new things about Media Queries and also Responsive Web Design.

## Acknowledgments

I sincerely want to appreciate Brad of Traversy Media on Youtube @ https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia. His crash course on CSS Grid really helped me get started with CSS Grid. It is also from the course that I saw him code this Project live and made me interested to also give it a try.
